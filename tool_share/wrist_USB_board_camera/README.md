## Wrist USB Board Camera

**Create by**: Hello Robot Inc

This design allows you to attach a USB board camera to the wrist yaw joint of Stretch. The wrist mounted camera can pan left-right, making it perfect for simple remote inspection tasks.

The camera can be integrated into your robot URDF by integrating its [stretch_description](./stretch_description) as described in the [Stretch ROS documentation](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_ros/tree/master/stretch_description).

1. Attach the Board_Camera_Ball_Shell to the wrist tool plate using the 8 M2 bolts
2. Attach the camera to the Board_Camera_Ball_Shell using 4 self-threading screws
3. Attach the USB cable and route it down and through the wrist yaw passage
4. Attach the Board_Camera_Ball_Cover using 1 self-threading screw
5. Plug the USB cable into the USB-A port on the wrist

NOTE: The USB cable that comes with the camera uses a JST-PH connector. You may want to make your own cable with a custom length using a right-angle USB-A cable. This may require a JST-PH crimp tool.

NOTE: A variety of USB board cameras are available from ELP and Spinel, among others. The shells may need to be modified to accommodate variations in the mechanical packaging of these cameras.
