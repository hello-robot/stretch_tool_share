## Assembly instructions                                                                                               
 [NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX Mount Assembly Instructions PDF](images/Stretch_2_NVIDIA_Jetson_Orin_AGX_Mount_Installation.pdf)                                                                                  
1. Cut the DC power cable 20" in length. Pigtail the cable and expose 3/16" of copper wire . Crimp with JST-VH crimper tool and attach the JST-VH 2 pin connector.

2. Remove base shell from Stretch base.

3. Connect the 2 pin connector to 12volt Aux on PIMU.

4. Using a digital multimeter place the <span style="color:red;">**positive (red) probe**</span> inside the barrel jack connector of the new cable, and touch the **negative (black) probe** on the outside of the barrel jack connector.

5. Turn on Stretch and measure the voltage coming out of new cable that is connected to the 12volt Aux connector using a digital multimeter. Ensure that the voltage reading is **positive 12V** or higher
      > [!WARNING]
      > Ensuring that the voltage coming out of the new cable is positive, is crucial in protecting Stretch's main power board from damaging.

6. Route cable through Aux hole in the base shell and re-install base shell.

7. Mount the Jetson Orin AGX to white delrin custom plate using 4x Torx Flat Head Thread-Cutting Screws for Metal.

8. Add 4x Male-Female Threaded Hex Standoff to Stretch Base accessory mounts.

9. Mount the white delrin custom plate to standoffs using 4x Steel Button Head Torx Screws.

10. Plug in ethernet cable to Jetson Orin AGX.

11. Plug your custom length DC power cable into the BIX power adaptor. Plug the Bix power adapter to Jetson Orin AGX.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The BIX Power Adapter is a crucial component that we highly recommend purchasing for this setup. It adds additional safety features to the power path system. Not adding this part to the setup can lead to the Jetson power system failing.

12. Attach 5x Cable tie mounts using 5x Phillips Rounded Head Thread forming screws.

13. Zip-tie cables and cut excess.

## Software

Adding this requires limiting the range of motion of the lift joint so that it does not collide with the part. To do this, modify the lower range in your ```stretch_user_params.yaml``` to:

```commandline
lift:
  range_m: [0.25, 1.xxx]
```

Note: `1.xx` is the calibrated upper bound found from ```stretch_params.py | grep lift | grep range_m```

Note: This conservatively limits the range of motion such that the standard gripper will not collide when stowed.
